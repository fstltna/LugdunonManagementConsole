# LugdunonManagementConsole
Allows you to manage your Lugdunon server with a text based GUI

---
Edit "lmc" and change the settings at the top if your lugdunon server is not in /root/lugdunon.

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

You also need to have my Lugdunon Startup Script installed.

Then copy "lmc" into a directory in your path and you should be ok.
